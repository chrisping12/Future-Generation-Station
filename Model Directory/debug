Great question — and once you see a decision boundary, it really clicks. Let’s break it down visually and conceptually.

⸻

What is a Decision Boundary?

At its core:

A decision boundary is the line (in 2D), curve, or surface (in higher dimensions) that separates different classes in your feature space.

It’s what your model learns.

In a binary classification task:
	•	The model says: “Everything on this side → Class 0, and everything over here → Class 1”
	•	For logistic regression, the decision boundary is linear — a straight line or hyperplane
	•	For nonlinear models (like random forest, SVM, or neural nets), it can bend, twist, and adapt

How It Works in Logistic Regression

Logistic regression models:

P(class=1) = sigmoid(w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + b)

The decision boundary is defined by:

w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + b = 0

That’s the threshold where the model thinks P(class=1) = 0.5.

Everything:
	•	Above the line → P > 0.5 → predict class 1
	•	Below the line → P < 0.5 → predict class 0

Visual Example (2 Features)

Let’s say we pick two features:
	•	rolling_pts_avg_5G
	•	rolling_min_avg_5G

We can plot:
	•	Each player-game as a point
	•	The color = true class (hit 10+ points or not)
	•	The model’s decision boundary across the space

Want to Try It?

If you run this in a Jupyter Notebook, it’ll show you the boundary:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Pick two features
X = features_df[['rolling_pts_avg_5G', 'rolling_min_avg_5G']].dropna()
y = features_df.loc[X.index, 'hit_10pts']

# Scale the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Fit the model
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(X_scaled, y)

# Plotting
x_min, x_max = X_scaled[:, 0].min() - 1, X_scaled[:, 0].max() + 1
y_min, y_max = X_scaled[:, 1].min() - 1, X_scaled[:, 1].max() + 1
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(x_min, x_max, 300),
                     np.linspace(y_min, y_max, 300))
Z = clf.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.3, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.scatter(X_scaled[:, 0], X_scaled[:, 1], c=y, edgecolors='k', cmap='coolwarm', s=60)
plt.xlabel('rolling_pts_avg_5G (scaled)')
plt.ylabel('rolling_min_avg_5G (scaled)')
plt.title('Logistic Regression Decision Boundary')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

Want to Go Further?

If you’d like to:
	•	Compare this with a random forest or SVM decision boundary
	•	Try different feature pairs
	•	Add model confidence shading

I can build you a flexible notebook template to play with.

Want me to do that?
