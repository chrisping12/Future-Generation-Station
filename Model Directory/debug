Perfect — here’s Option 1 as a clean snippet you can drop into your script:

# Convert TEAM_ID to numeric, forcing non-numeric values to NaN
team_df['TEAM_ID'] = pd.to_numeric(team_df['TEAM_ID'], errors='coerce')

# Drop rows where TEAM_ID is NaN (i.e., originally non-numeric)
team_df = team_df[team_df['TEAM_ID'].notnull()]

Optional: If you want TEAM_ID to be an integer again after filtering:

team_df['TEAM_ID'] = team_df['TEAM_ID'].astype(int)

Let me know if you’d like to apply the same cleanup to player data too.
