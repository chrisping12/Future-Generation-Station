These are the required variables the script is trying to calc predictions for. 

The features listed all have int populating their cells.  The operators listed below are the ones im worried about causing this error. 

adjusted_shot_creation 
delta_fga_vs_rolling 
fg_pct_vs_avg_delta 
rolliing_pts_from_ft_5g
rolling_usg_pct_5g
volume_efficienct_to_pts
ceil
exp
inv
max
min
round

Here is a copy of my function

def model_func(row):
            try:
                local_vars = {var: row.get(var, np.nan) for var in required_vars}
                return eval(
                    equation_str,
                    {
                        "__builtins__": None,
                        "sqrt": safe_sqrt,
                        "log": safe_log,
                        "inv": safe_inv,
                        "exp": np.exp,
                        "ceil": np.ceil,
                        "floor": np.floor,
                        "round": round,
                        "max": max,
                        "min": min,
                        "abs": abs
