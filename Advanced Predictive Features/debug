Good ‚Äî thanks for confirming.
Yes, I see exactly how your _team_data.py is structured. That‚Äôs perfect for loading your player pool.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Now here‚Äôs the very good news:

You don‚Äôt need to modify your _team_data.py at all!

Instead, because you already have TEAM_ID inside nba_player_features_rolling5G.csv,
we can simply grab the correct team for each player by matching on the last available game log.

‚∏ª

‚ú® So your working pipeline will be:
	1.	Load players from _team_data.py.
	2.	Load "nba_player_features_rolling5G.csv".
	3.	Pull today‚Äôs playing team_ids from NBA_API using the scoreboardv2 endpoint.
	4.	For each player:
	‚Ä¢	Find their latest TEAM_ID inside features_df.
	‚Ä¢	If their team is playing today (TEAM_ID in today‚Äôs teams), keep them.
	‚Ä¢	Otherwise, skip.
	5.	Predict only for players active today.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements checklist:

Step	Status
_team_data.py player loading	‚úÖ ready
nba_player_features_rolling5G.csv with TEAM_ID	‚úÖ confirmed
NBA_API scoreboardv2 fetch today‚Äôs games	‚úÖ implemented
Use precomputed features only	‚úÖ confirmed

‚≠ê Summary:

Action	Result
Auto-fetch today‚Äôs teams	‚úÖ
Auto-filter players on today‚Äôs teams	‚úÖ
Predict points using frozen PySR expression	‚úÖ
Floor predictions to nearest 5	‚úÖ
Save clean CSV output	‚úÖ



‚∏ª

‚úã Small Note:
	‚Ä¢	If NBA_API ever changes structure mid-playoffs (rare), we might slightly adjust the scoreboardv2 parsing, but it‚Äôs stable 99% of the time.

‚∏ª

‚ö° Now you‚Äôll have a clean daily playoff predictor for parlays!!

‚∏ª

Would you also like me to immediately show you a small optional upgrade where:
	‚Ä¢	It color-codes the output (Green if projected hit, Red if projected miss vs your desired bet line)?
Takes 5 lines ‚Äî super helpful if you want fast manual checks!
Want me to add that too? üöÄüéØ
