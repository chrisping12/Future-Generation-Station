‚úã Question for you to confirm before I start building this:

What format is _team_data.py in?
ANSWER:

players_by_team = {
    "Celtics": [
        ("Jayson Tatum"),
        ("Jaylen Brown"),
        ("Derrick White"),
        ("Jrue Holiday"),
        ("Payton Pritchard"),
        ("Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is")
    ],
    "Knicks": [
        ("Karl-Anthony Towns"),
        ("Jalen Brunson"),
        ("OG Anunoby"),
        ("Mikal Bridges"),
        ("Josh Hart"),
        ("Miles McBride")
    ],   


And second:
	‚Ä¢	Will you always be pulling the latest 5 games automatically? (i.e., we auto-fetch 5 past games using NBA_API)?
		FOR NOW YES WE WILL BE USING 5G AVG

	‚Ä¢	Do you have a static game log file you want to read from?
		IM WONDERING IF WE CAN READ FROM "features_df just like PYSR did. This will have all featrues for the entire season to date.

‚≠ê Once you answer, I can build a full version of this system for you step-by-step!

This will be the cleanest, most reliable, betting-grade system you‚Äôve ever had.
Ready??
(Just tell me how _team_data.py looks and whether to fetch live games or read from a file!) üöÄ
