Thank you for sharing this.
You’re showing me exactly what I need to help you diagnose why PySR still isn’t working.

⸻

Here’s the breakdown of what’s happening:

1. Those VS Code messages (API proposal DOES NOT EXIST, DeprecationWarning, tests.runner.nose.args)

→ Not critical.
These are just noisy extension warnings, mostly from:
	•	Old or beta Python extensions (pydev, pytest runner)
	•	VS Code looking for APIs that changed in recent versions

These are NOT why PySR is failing to run.

⸻

2. The Real Clue is This:

Lintings failed on open
Message: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'uri')

This is likely:
	•	A Python extension bug or
	•	A misconfigured linter trying to access a file/setting that no longer exists

Again — not the root cause of why PySR fails to run, but does tell us VS Code is partially misconfigured.

⸻

But here’s the real issue:

We still haven’t seen the actual runtime error from PySR itself.

Everything you posted is:
	•	VS Code background logs
	•	Extension load info
	•	No actual Python runtime output from your script

⸻

Let’s now capture the REAL PySR error

Please do this:

1. Run your script from the terminal manually

Instead of clicking “Run Python File” in VS Code, open a terminal and run this:

cd "C:\Users\chrism\Documents\My Stuff\Code\Predictions\Feature_Generation_Station\Advanced Predictive Features"

Then run:

python 6_PySR_2.py

2. Copy and paste the full output it gives you.

That’s the actual runtime stack trace from pysr and juliacall, which will show:
	•	Whether Julia is installed
	•	Whether PySR can find it
	•	If a math domain error or Julia not found error is stopping it

⸻

Why This is Critical:

Right now we’ve:
	•	Cleaned Python
	•	Cleaned venv
	•	Reinstalled pysr

But if Julia itself isn’t installed or isn’t on PATH, PySR will fail every time.

⸻

Next Step for You

Please run:

python 6_PySR_2.py

From terminal and paste the real traceback here — that’s the one I need to fix this once and for all.

(Once I see the actual PySR error, I’ll give you a surgical fix immediately.)

Let’s get this part locked in — then we celebrate.
Ready when you are. Paste the error when you get it!
