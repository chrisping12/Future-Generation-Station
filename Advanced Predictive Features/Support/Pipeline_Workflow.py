{team_data.py} - houses all of the players by team I follow and pred
{feature_helpers.py} - 
{team_stat_helpers.py}


{team_adv_tracker.py} - Goes
{player_adv_tracker.py}
    {quickfix_chunks.py} (If Needed) removed all gleague teams from csv
{chunks_combiner_player_team.py} ####_adv_tracker.py files into one large csv ready for merging together
{TnP_merger.py} merged player and team 'adv_tracker csv's into one large csv ready for feature builder


{Feature_Builder.ipynb}
This is probably the most valuable. This is a raw dataframe with loads of features. Needing standardScaler or log scaler for ML Gradient boost or 
Recurring Neural Networks, Random Forest preparation. 

{PySR.py} - Model needs python 3.11. Anything lower than 3.12
{Decision Boundary Pairplot Seaborn} View feature interaction. for top 10 features used in expressions
{PySR_Model_B.ipynb}
{Win Rate Analyzer.ipynb}

May need Neural Network code
gradient boost code.
