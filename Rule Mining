So how does one go about making one 
of the best nba prediction models around 
with the guided use of ChatGPT? We have 
been doing a lot of work on compiling a 
list of features we run through correlation 
analysis, MI, and F1 etc but I feel like 
that particular type of data is very much 
for advanced Prediction algorithms.. but 
what other types of data would one use while 
on the path to the correct bet? I feel 
something like a binary type signal is used. 
Say if no one in history has ever won a game 
after _____ the last number of ____ games.. 
no matter what the prediction model predicts 
for points, the binary classification would 
null it.. I don’t exactly know what I’m trying 
to say but do you think you get the gist of 
my question?
